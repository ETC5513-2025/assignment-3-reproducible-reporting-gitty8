## Problem Introduction
**Background & Motivation**

-   🌍 **Growing Global Mobility**:\
    International education sector expanding rapidly

-   💰 **Quality vs Affordability Dilemma**:\
    Total expenses vary greatly across countries, and students seek high-quality programs and affordable study destinations.

-   📊 **Information Gap**:\
    Limited systematic comparison of total education costs across top-ranking university destinations

::: notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Questions**

❓ Do top QS rankings (higher academic quality) = higher costs?

❓ Which countries offer best value for international students?

🎯 Goal: Compare study cost vs. QS ranking to find cost-effective options

::: notes
This brings us to our main questions: Do top QS rankings university actually equal higher costs? And which countries offer the best value for international students?

Our goal is simple: we want to compare study costs with university rankings to help   students weigh academic excellence against financial burden — and find countries where they can achieve both.

## Dataset Description

#### Data Sources:

-   [`QS World University Rankings 2024-2025:`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrylljk/worlds-best-universities-qs-rankings-2025)

🎓 Academic reputation, graduate employability, sustainability metrics\
🎓 Global benchmark for university comparison

-   [`Kaggle: International Education Cost Dataset:`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/cost-of-international-education)

💸 Comprehensive cost breakdown by country\
💸 Includes Tuition + Living + Visa + Insurance

::: notes
To answer these questions, we used two main data sources. First, the QS World University Rankings for 2024-2025. Second, we used the International Education Cost Dataset from Kaggle. This data shows us how much it costs to study in different countries. It includes everything - tuition fees, living costs, visa fees, and insurance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Focus:

-   **Academic Level:**

    -   Master's degree programs only

    <!-- -->

    -   Standardized comparison across countries

-   **Geographic Scope:**

    -   Top 10 countries with the highest QS ranking

    -   Global coverage of major study destinations

-   **Time Frame:**

    -   QS Rankings: 2024-2025 academic year

::: notes
We made our research focused. We only looked at Master's degree programs, so we could compare fairly across countries. We picked the top 10 countries that have the highest QS rankings. This gave us a good mix of popular study destinations.

::: notes
Our method was straightforward and followed a clear process. We merged the QS ranking data from 2024 and 2025, identified the top 10 countries from these rankings, filtered the International Cost dataset for these countries, selected only Master's level programs, and finally calculated the total study cost including tuition, rent, visa fees, and insurance in USD.

#### Data Processing Steps 
 In this section, I’ll walk you through how we processed the data before performing our analysis. As shown in the table, our workflow followed five main steps: 1.⁠ ⁠Merged QS 2024 and 2025 rankings 2.⁠ ⁠Identified top 10 countries by QS Top 100 presence 3.⁠ ⁠Filtered Kaggle dataset for these countries 4.⁠ ⁠Focused on Master’s level programs 5.⁠ ⁠Calculated total study cost (Tuition + Rent + Visa + Insurance) 
 We used R functions like filter(), mutate(), and rowSums() to clean and summarize the data. 

### Analysis Tools & Techniques

⁠ markdown \## Analysis Tools & Techniques

-   Analysis performed using **R** and Quarto for full reproducibility\
-   Used `tidyverse` for data processing and cleaning\
-   Created visualizations using `ggplot2`\
-   Calculated averages for tuition, rent, and total study cost per country\
-   Performed simple correlation analysis between costs and QS rankings

Results – Cost Comparison Table \## Results – Study Cost Rankings

We analyzed the average total cost of studying a Master's degree across the top QS-ranked countries. This includes tuition, rent, visa fees, and insurance.

 ⁠{r} kable(merged_df\[order(merged_df\$Avg_Total_Cost), \], caption = "Table 1: Total Study Cost and QS Top 100 Count by Country")

⁠ • 🇺🇸 United States: Highest cost (\~USD 100,200)

• 🇦🇺 Australia: Second highest (\~USD 70,477)

• 🇰🇷 South Korea: Lowest average cost

• Lower-cost countries (Germany, China) also have strong QS presence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Results – Bar Chart of Costs

 ⁠markdown \## Results – Visual Comparison

⁠ {r} ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = reorder(Country, Avg_Total_Cost), y = Avg_Total_Cost)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") + labs( title = "Figure 1: Average Total Study Cost by Country", x = "Country", y = "Avg Total Cost (USD)" ) + theme_minimal()  ⁠ Australia and the US are among the most expensive destinations, while South Korea, Germany, and China offer affordability with quality. This highlights a trade-off between academic prestige and financial accessibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion

-   Our findings show that **academic prestige doesn’t guarantee affordability**.

-   Countries like the **US (\~\$100,200)** and **Australia (\~\$70,500)** have many top QS-ranked universities but also **very high study costs**.

-   On the other hand, **South Korea (\~\$22,800)**, **Germany (\~\$24,900)**, and **China (\~\$28,300)** offer **much lower costs** while maintaining QS presence.

-   These patterns reflect how **national policies**, such as Germany’s free public university system, play a key role in affordability.

-   This proves that students can access **quality education without breaking the bank**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Limitations

-   We used **average country-level costs**, which may not reflect variation between cities or universities.
-   **Scholarships and grants** were not considered, yet these can significantly lower actual costs.
-   **Exchange rates** fluctuate over time, which could impact affordability.
-   Language, cultural preferences, and long-term goals (e.g., migration, job prospects) were also **not included**, though they’re critical for many students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion & Recommendations

🧠 **Conclusion** - No direct link between QS rank and affordability. - Students can find **excellent education at lower costs** in countries like South Korea, Germany, and China. - **Affordability and quality must be balanced** when choosing a destination.

✅ **Recommendations** - **Students**: Look beyond rankings — evaluate total cost of attendance. - **Institutions & policymakers**: Be more transparent; offer **more financial support**. - **Future researchers**: Include job outcomes, immigration pathways, and scholarships for a full picture.
