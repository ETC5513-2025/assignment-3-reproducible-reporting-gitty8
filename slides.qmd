### PROBLEM INTRODUCTION

**Background & Motivation**

-   🌍 **Growing Global Mobility**:\
    International education sector expanding rapidly

-   💰 **Quality vs Affordability Dilemma**:\
    Total expenses vary greatly across countries, and students seek high-quality programs and affordable study destinations.

-   📊 **Information Gap**:\
    Limited systematic comparison of total education costs across top-ranking university destinations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Questions**

❓ Do top QS rankings (higher academic quality) = higher costs?

❓ Which countries offer best value for international students?

🎯 Goal: Compare study cost vs. QS ranking to find cost-effective options

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DATASET DESCRIPTION

#### Data Sources:

🎓 [`QS World University Rankings 2024-2025`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrylljk/worlds-best-universities-qs-rankings-2025):\
A global benchmark for top universities

💸 [`Kaggle: International Education Cost Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/cost-of-international-education) :\
Comprehensive study expense breakdown by country

### Focus:

🎯 **Academic Level**: Master’s programs only, for consistent comparison

🌍 **Geographic Coverage**: Top 10 countries from QS rankings – major global study destinations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Used R functions like `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `rowSums()` to clean and summarize the data efficiently.

This structured processing ensured that our dataset was accurate, relevant, and ready for meaningful comparison.

## RESULTS – Study Cost Rankings {.smaller}

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

df <- read_csv("data/cleaned_education_costs.csv")
qs_df <- read_csv("data/top_countries.csv")

summary_df <- df %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(
    `Average Tuition` = round(mean(Tuition_USD), 0),
    `Average Rent` = round(mean(Rent_USD * 12 * Duration_Years), 0),
    `Average Total Cost` = round(mean(Total_Cost_USD), 0),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

merged_df <- left_join(summary_df, qs_df, by = "Country")
```

```{r}
#| label: table-results
#| echo: false

library(knitr)

kable(merged_df[order(merged_df$`Average Total Cost`), ],
      caption = "Table: Country Ranking by Total Study Cost and QS Top 100 Count")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### RESULTS – Visual Comparison

This bar chart illustrates the variation in total study cost by country.

```{r}
#| label: barplot-costs
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = reorder(Country, `Average Total Cost`), y = `Average Total Cost`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Total Study Cost by Country",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Average Total Cost (USD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DISCUSSION

-   Our findings show that **academic prestige doesn’t guarantee affordability**.

-   Countries like the **US (\~\$100,200)** and **Australia (\~\$70,500)** have many top QS-ranked universities but also **very high study costs**.

-   On the other hand, **South Korea (\~\$22,800)**, **Germany (\~\$24,900)**, and **China (\~\$28,300)** offer **much lower costs** while maintaining QS presence.

-   These patterns reflect how **national policies**, such as Germany’s free public university system, play a key role in affordability.

-   This proves that students can access **quality education without breaking the bank**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### STUDY LIMITATIONS

-   We used **average country-level costs**, which may not reflect variation between cities or universities.

-   **Scholarships and grants** were not considered, yet these can significantly lower actual costs.

-   **Exchange rates** fluctuate over time, which could impact affordability.

-   Language, cultural preferences, and long-term goals (e.g., migration, job prospects) were also **not included**, though they’re critical for many students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CONCLUSION & RECOMMANDATIONS {.smaller}

🧠 **Conclusion**

-   No direct link between QS rank and affordability.
-   Students can find **excellent education at lower costs** in countries like South Korea, Germany, and China
-   **Affordability and quality must be balanced** when choosing a destination.

✅ **Recommendations**

-   **Students**: Look beyond rankings — evaluate total cost of attendance.
-   **Institutions & policymakers**: Be more transparent; offer **more financial support**.
-   **Future researchers**: Include job outcomes, immigration pathways, and scholarships for a full picture.
