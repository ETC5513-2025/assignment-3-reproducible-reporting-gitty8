## Problem Introduction
**Background & Motivation**

-   🌍 **Growing Global Mobility**:\
    International education sector expanding rapidly

-   💰 **Quality vs Affordability Dilemma**:\
    Total expenses vary greatly across countries, and students seek high-quality programs and affordable study destinations.

-   📊 **Information Gap**:\
    Limited systematic comparison of total education costs across top-ranking university destinations


------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Questions**

❓ Do top QS rankings (higher academic quality) = higher costs?

❓ Which countries offer best value for international students?

🎯 Goal: Compare study cost vs. QS ranking to find cost-effective options


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset Description

#### Data Sources:

-   [`QS World University Rankings 2024-2025:`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrylljk/worlds-best-universities-qs-rankings-2025)

🎓 Academic reputation, graduate employability, sustainability metrics\
🎓 Global benchmark for university comparison

-   [`Kaggle: International Education Cost Dataset:`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/cost-of-international-education)

💸 Comprehensive cost breakdown by country\
💸 Includes Tuition + Living + Visa + Insurance



------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Focus:

-   **Academic Level:**

    -   Master's degree programs only

    
    -   Standardized comparison across countries

-   **Geographic Scope:**

    -   Top 10 countries with the highest QS ranking

    -   Global coverage of major study destinations

-   **Time Frame:**

    -   QS Rankings: 2024-2025 academic year

#### Data Processing Steps 
In this section, I’ll walk you through how we processed the data before performing our analysis. As shown in the table, our workflow followed five main steps: 1.⁠ ⁠Merged QS 2024 and 2025 rankings 2.⁠ ⁠Identified top 10 countries by QS Top 100 presence 3.⁠ ⁠Filtered Kaggle dataset for these countries 4.⁠ ⁠Focused on Master’s level programs 5.⁠ ⁠Calculated total study cost (Tuition + Rent + Visa + Insurance) 
 We used R functions like filter(), mutate(), and rowSums() to clean and summarize the data. 

### Analysis Tools & Techniques

⁠ markdown \## Analysis Tools & Techniques

-   Analysis performed using **R** and Quarto for full reproducibility\
-   Used `tidyverse` for data processing and cleaning\
-   Created visualizations using `ggplot2`\
-   Calculated averages for tuition, rent, and total study cost per country\
-   Performed simple correlation analysis between costs and QS rankings

Results – Cost Comparison Table \## Results – Study Cost Rankings

We analyzed the average total cost of studying a Master's degree across the top QS-ranked countries. This includes tuition, rent, visa fees, and insurance.

 ⁠{r} kable(merged_df\[order(merged_df\$Avg_Total_Cost), \], caption = "Table 1: Total Study Cost and QS Top 100 Count by Country")

⁠ • 🇺🇸 United States: Highest cost (\~USD 100,200)

• 🇦🇺 Australia: Second highest (\~USD 70,477)

• 🇰🇷 South Korea: Lowest average cost

• Lower-cost countries (Germany, China) also have strong QS presence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Results – Bar Chart of Costs

 ⁠markdown \## Results – Visual Comparison

⁠ {r} ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = reorder(Country, Avg_Total_Cost), y = Avg_Total_Cost)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") + labs( title = "Figure 1: Average Total Study Cost by Country", x = "Country", y = "Avg Total Cost (USD)" ) + theme_minimal()  ⁠ Australia and the US are among the most expensive destinations, while South Korea, Germany, and China offer affordability with quality. This highlights a trade-off between academic prestige and financial accessibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion

-   Our findings show that **academic prestige doesn’t guarantee affordability**.

-   Countries like the **US (\~\$100,200)** and **Australia (\~\$70,500)** have many top QS-ranked universities but also **very high study costs**.

-   On the other hand, **South Korea (\~\$22,800)**, **Germany (\~\$24,900)**, and **China (\~\$28,300)** offer **much lower costs** while maintaining QS presence.

-   These patterns reflect how **national policies**, such as Germany’s free public university system, play a key role in affordability.

-   This proves that students can access **quality education without breaking the bank**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Limitations

-   We used **average country-level costs**, which may not reflect variation between cities or universities.
-   **Scholarships and grants** were not considered, yet these can significantly lower actual costs.
-   **Exchange rates** fluctuate over time, which could impact affordability.
-   Language, cultural preferences, and long-term goals (e.g., migration, job prospects) were also **not included**, though they’re critical for many students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion & Recommendations

🧠 **Conclusion** - No direct link between QS rank and affordability. - Students can find **excellent education at lower costs** in countries like South Korea, Germany, and China. - **Affordability and quality must be balanced** when choosing a destination.

✅ **Recommendations** - **Students**: Look beyond rankings — evaluate total cost of attendance. - **Institutions & policymakers**: Be more transparent; offer **more financial support**. - **Future researchers**: Include job outcomes, immigration pathways, and scholarships for a full picture.
