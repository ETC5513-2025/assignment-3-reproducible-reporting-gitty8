## Problem Introduction

- üåç **Growing Global Mobility**: 
International education sector expanding rapidly

- üí∞ **Quality vs Affordability Dilemma**: 
Costs vary a lot between countries, and students seek both academic excellence and financial feasibility

- üìä **Information Gap**:  
Limited systematic comparison of education costs across top-ranking university destinations

---

**Key Questions**

- ‚ùì Do top QSrankings (higher academic quality) = higher costs?
- ‚ùì Which countries offer best value for international students?
- üéØ Goal: Compare study cost vs. QS ranking to find cost-effective options

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset Description
#### Data Sources:

- **QS World University Rankings 2024-2025:**

üéì Academic reputation, graduate employability, sustainability metrics
üéì Global benchmark for university comparison

- **Kaggle: International Education Cost Dataset:**

üí∏ Comprehensive cost breakdown by country
üí∏ Includes Tuition + Living + Visa + Insurance


#### Focus:

**Academic Level**: 
- `Master's degree programs only`
- Standardized comparison across countries

**Geographic Scope:**
- Top 10 countries with the highest QS ranking
- Global coverage of major study destinations

**Time Frame:**
- QS Rankings: 2024-2025 academic yearr

library(DiagrammeR)
DiagrammeR::grViz("

")
```

#### Data Processing Steps

In this section, I‚Äôll walk you through how we processed the data before performing our analysis. As shown in the table, our workflow followed five main steps: 1.‚Å† ‚Å†Merged QS 2024 and 2025 rankings 2.‚Å† ‚Å†Identified top 10 countries by QS Top 100 presence 3.‚Å† ‚Å†Filtered Kaggle dataset for these countries 4.‚Å† ‚Å†Focused on Master‚Äôs level programs 5.‚Å† ‚Å†Calculated total study cost (Tuition + Rent + Visa + Insurance)

We used R functions like filter(), mutate(), and rowSums() to clean and summarize the data.
```{r}

#| tbl-cap: "Data processing stages and R functions used"

### Analysis Tools & Techniques

‚Å†‚ÄØmarkdown \## Analysis Tools & Techniques

-   Analysis performed using **R** and Quarto for full reproducibility\
-   Used `tidyverse` for data processing and cleaning\
-   Created visualizations using `ggplot2`\
-   Calculated averages for tuition, rent, and total study cost per country\
-   Performed simple correlation analysis between costs and QS rankings

Results ‚Äì Cost Comparison Table \## Results ‚Äì Study Cost Rankings

We analyzed the average total cost of studying a Master's degree across the top QS-ranked countries. This includes tuition, rent, visa fees, and insurance.

‚ÄØ‚Å†{r} kable(merged_df\[order(merged_df\$Avg_Total_Cost), \], caption = "Table 1: Total Study Cost and QS Top 100 Count by Country")

‚Å†‚ÄØ‚Ä¢ üá∫üá∏ United States: Highest cost (\~USD 100,200)

‚Ä¢ üá¶üá∫ Australia: Second highest (\~USD 70,477)

‚Ä¢ üá∞üá∑ South Korea: Lowest average cost

‚Ä¢ Lower-cost countries (Germany, China) also have strong QS presence

### Results ‚Äì Bar Chart of Costs

‚ÄØ‚Å†markdown \## Results ‚Äì Visual Comparison

‚Å†‚ÄØ{r} ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = reorder(Country, Avg_Total_Cost), y = Avg_Total_Cost)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") + labs( title = "Figure 1: Average Total Study Cost by Country", x = "Country", y = "Avg Total Cost (USD)" ) + theme_minimal() ‚ÄØ‚Å† Australia and the US are among the most expensive destinations, while South Korea, Germany, and China offer affordability with quality. This highlights a trade-off between academic prestige and financial accessibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion

-   Our findings show that **academic prestige doesn‚Äôt guarantee affordability**.

-   Countries like the **US (\~\$100,200)** and **Australia (\~\$70,500)** have many top QS-ranked universities but also **very high study costs**.

-   On the other hand, **South Korea (\~\$22,800)**, **Germany (\~\$24,900)**, and **China (\~\$28,300)** offer **much lower costs** while maintaining QS presence.

-   These patterns reflect how **national policies**, such as Germany‚Äôs free public university system, play a key role in affordability.

-   This proves that students can access **quality education without breaking the bank**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Limitations

-   We used **average country-level costs**, which may not reflect variation between cities or universities.
-   **Scholarships and grants** were not considered, yet these can significantly lower actual costs.
-   **Exchange rates** fluctuate over time, which could impact affordability.
-   Language, cultural preferences, and long-term goals (e.g., migration, job prospects) were also **not included**, though they‚Äôre critical for many students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion & Recommendations

üß† **Conclusion** - No direct link between QS rank and affordability. - Students can find **excellent education at lower costs** in countries like South Korea, Germany, and China. - **Affordability and quality must be balanced** when choosing a destination.

‚úÖ **Recommendations** - **Students**: Look beyond rankings ‚Äî evaluate total cost of attendance. - **Institutions & policymakers**: Be more transparent; offer **more financial support**. - **Future researchers**: Include job outcomes, immigration pathways, and scholarships for a full picture.
