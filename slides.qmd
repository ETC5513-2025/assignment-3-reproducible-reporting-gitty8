## Problem Introduction

-   *Growing Global Mobility*: International education sector expanding rapidly
-   *Quality vs Affordability Dilemma*: Costs vary a lot between countries, and students seek both academic excellence and financial feasibility
-   *Information Gap*: Limited systematic comparison of education costs across top-ranking university destinations ::: {.fragment}

*Key Questions* •⁠ ⁠Do top QSrankings (higher academic quality) = higher costs? •⁠ ⁠Which countries offer best value for international students? •⁠ ⁠Goal: Compare study cost vs. QS ranking to find cost-effective options :::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset description

### Data Sources:

*QS World University Rankings 2024-2025:*

•⁠ ⁠Academic reputation, graduate employability, sustainability metrics

•⁠ ⁠Global benchmark for university comparison

*Kaggle International Education Cost Dataset:*

•⁠ ⁠Comprehensive cost breakdownc by country

•⁠ ⁠Includes Tuition + Living + Visa + Insurance

::: fragment
### Research Focus:

*Academic Level*:

•⁠ ⁠\*Master's degree programs only

• ⁠Standardized comparison across countries

*Geographic Scope:*

•⁠ ⁠Top 10 countries with the highest QS ranking

•⁠ ⁠Global coverage of major study destinations

*Time Frame:* •⁠ ⁠QS Rankings: 2024-2025 academic year

### Data Processing Steps

In this section, I’ll walk you through how we processed the data before performing our analysis. As shown in the table, our workflow followed five main steps: 1.⁠ ⁠Merged QS 2024 and 2025 rankings 2.⁠ ⁠Identified top 10 countries by QS Top 100 presence 3.⁠ ⁠Filtered Kaggle dataset for these countries 4.⁠ ⁠Focused on Master’s level programs 5.⁠ ⁠Calculated total study cost (Tuition + Rent + Visa + Insurance)

We used R functions like filter(), mutate(), and rowSums() to clean and summarize the data.

### Analysis Tools & Techniques

⁠ markdown \## Analysis Tools & Techniques

-   Analysis performed using **R** and Quarto for full reproducibility\
-   Used `tidyverse` for data processing and cleaning\
-   Created visualizations using `ggplot2`\
-   Calculated averages for tuition, rent, and total study cost per country\
-   Performed simple correlation analysis between costs and QS rankings

Slide 3: Results – Cost Comparison Table \## Results – Study Cost Rankings

We analyzed the average total cost of studying a Master's degree across the top QS-ranked countries. This includes tuition, rent, visa fees, and insurance.

 ⁠{r} kable(merged_df\[order(merged_df\$Avg_Total_Cost), \], caption = "Table 1: Total Study Cost and QS Top 100 Count by Country")

⁠ • 🇺🇸 United States: Highest cost (\~USD 100,200)

• 🇦🇺 Australia: Second highest (\~USD 70,477)

• 🇰🇷 South Korea: Lowest average cost

• Lower-cost countries (Germany, China) also have strong QS presence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Results – Bar Chart of Costs

 ⁠markdown \## Results – Visual Comparison

⁠ {r} ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = reorder(Country, Avg_Total_Cost), y = Avg_Total_Cost)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") + labs( title = "Figure 1: Average Total Study Cost by Country", x = "Country", y = "Avg Total Cost (USD)" ) + theme_minimal()  ⁠ Australia and the US are among the most expensive destinations, while South Korea, Germany, and China offer affordability with quality. This highlights a trade-off between academic prestige and financial accessibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion

-   Our findings show that **academic prestige doesn’t guarantee affordability**.

-   Countries like the **US (\~\$100,200)** and **Australia (\~\$70,500)** have many top QS-ranked universities but also **very high study costs**.

-   On the other hand, **South Korea (\~\$22,800)**, **Germany (\~\$24,900)**, and **China (\~\$28,300)** offer **much lower costs** while maintaining QS presence.

-   These patterns reflect how **national policies**, such as Germany’s free public university system, play a key role in affordability.

-   This proves that students can access **quality education without breaking the bank**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Limitations

-   We used **average country-level costs**, which may not reflect variation between cities or universities.
-   **Scholarships and grants** were not considered, yet these can significantly lower actual costs.
-   **Exchange rates** fluctuate over time, which could impact affordability.
-   Language, cultural preferences, and long-term goals (e.g., migration, job prospects) were also **not included**, though they’re critical for many students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion & Recommendations

🧠 **Conclusion** - No direct link between QS rank and affordability. - Students can find **excellent education at lower costs** in countries like South Korea, Germany, and China. - **Affordability and quality must be balanced** when choosing a destination.

✅ **Recommendations** - **Students**: Look beyond rankings — evaluate total cost of attendance. - **Institutions & policymakers**: Be more transparent; offer **more financial support**. - **Future researchers**: Include job outcomes, immigration pathways, and scholarships for a full picture.
