## Problem Introduction
**Background & Motivation**

-   🌍 **Growing Global Mobility**:\
    International education sector expanding rapidly

-   💰 **Quality vs Affordability Dilemma**:\
    Total expenses vary greatly across countries, and students seek high-quality programs and affordable study destinations.

-   📊 **Information Gap**:\
    Limited systematic comparison of total education costs across top-ranking university destinations


------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Questions**

❓ Do top QS rankings (higher academic quality) = higher costs?

❓ Which countries offer best value for international students?

🎯 Goal: Compare study cost vs. QS ranking to find cost-effective options


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔧 Data Processing Steps

👣 **Step-by-step Workflow Before Analysis**

-    Merged QS 2024 & 2025 rankings  
-   Identified Top 10 countries based on QS Top 100 presence  
-   Filtered Kaggle dataset for these selected countries  
-   Focused on **Master’s-level programs only**  
-   Calculated **Total Study Cost** = Tuition + Rent + Visa + Insurance

Used R functions like `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `rowSums()` to clean and summarize the data efficiently.

This structured processing ensured that our dataset was accurate, relevant, and ready for meaningful comparison.

```{mermaid}
#| label: tbl-processing
#| tbl-cap: "Table: Data processing stages and R functions used"
#| echo: false

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

processing_stages <- data.frame(
  Stage = c("1. Data Merging", "2. Country Selection", "3. Data Filtering", 
            "4. Level Selection", "5. Cost Calculation"),
  Procedure = c("Combine QS 2024 & 2025", "Identify top 10 countries", 
                "Filter Kaggle by countries", "Select master's programs", 
                "Sum all cost components"),
  R_Functions = c("rbind(), bind_rows()", "group_by(), top_n()", 
                  "filter(), %in%", "filter()", "mutate(), rowSums()"),
  Output = c("Merged QS data", "Top 10 countries list", "Country-matched data", 
             "Master's level data", "Total cost dataset")
)

kable(processing_stages,
      col.names = c("Stage", "Procedure", "R Functions", "Output"),
      format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE)

## Results – Study Cost Rankings

We analyzed the average total cost of studying a Master's degree across the top QS-ranked countries.  
This includes tuition, rent, visa fees, and insurance.

Key Results:
- United States: Highest cost (~USD 100,200)  
- Australia: Second highest (~USD 70,477)  
- South Korea: Lowest average cost  
- Germany and China: Affordable options with strong QS presence

#| label: table-results
#| echo: false
kable(merged_df[order(merged_df$Avg_Total_Cost), ],
      caption = "Table: Country Ranking by Total Study Cost and QS Top 100 Count")
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results – Visual Comparison

This bar chart illustrates the variation in total study cost by country.

```{r}
#| label: barplot-costs
#| echo: false

ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = reorder(Country, Avg_Total_Cost), y = Avg_Total_Cost)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Total Study Cost by Country",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Average Total Cost (USD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
Observation:

The United States and Australia are the most expensive.

South Korea, Germany, and China are significantly more affordable.

There is a trade-off between academic prestige and financial accessibility.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Discussion

-   Our findings show that **academic prestige doesn’t guarantee affordability**.

-   Countries like the **US (\~\$100,200)** and **Australia (\~\$70,500)** have many top QS-ranked universities but also **very high study costs**.

-   On the other hand, **South Korea (\~\$22,800)**, **Germany (\~\$24,900)**, and **China (\~\$28,300)** offer **much lower costs** while maintaining QS presence.

-   These patterns reflect how **national policies**, such as Germany’s free public university system, play a key role in affordability.

-   This proves that students can access **quality education without breaking the bank**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Limitations

-   We used **average country-level costs**, which may not reflect variation between cities or universities.
-   **Scholarships and grants** were not considered, yet these can significantly lower actual costs.
-   **Exchange rates** fluctuate over time, which could impact affordability.
-   Language, cultural preferences, and long-term goals (e.g., migration, job prospects) were also **not included**, though they’re critical for many students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion & Recommendations

🧠 **Conclusion** - No direct link between QS rank and affordability. - Students can find **excellent education at lower costs** in countries like South Korea, Germany, and China. - **Affordability and quality must be balanced** when choosing a destination.

✅ **Recommendations** - **Students**: Look beyond rankings — evaluate total cost of attendance. - **Institutions & policymakers**: Be more transparent; offer **more financial support**. - **Future researchers**: Include job outcomes, immigration pathways, and scholarships for a full picture.
