## Problem Introduction
**Background & Motivation**

-   🌍 **Growing Global Mobility**:\
    International education sector expanding rapidly

-   💰 **Quality vs Affordability Dilemma**:\
    Total expenses vary greatly across countries, and students seek high-quality programs and affordable study destinations.

-   📊 **Information Gap**:\
    Limited systematic comparison of total education costs across top-ranking university destinations


------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Questions**

❓ Do top QS rankings (higher academic quality) = higher costs?

❓ Which countries offer best value for international students?

🎯 Goal: Compare study cost vs. QS ranking to find cost-effective options


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset Description

## Discussion

-   Our findings show that **academic prestige doesn’t guarantee affordability**.

-   Countries like the **US (\~\$100,200)** and **Australia (\~\$70,500)** have many top QS-ranked universities but also **very high study costs**.

-   On the other hand, **South Korea (\~\$22,800)**, **Germany (\~\$24,900)**, and **China (\~\$28,300)** offer **much lower costs** while maintaining QS presence.

-   These patterns reflect how **national policies**, such as Germany’s free public university system, play a key role in affordability.

-   This proves that students can access **quality education without breaking the bank**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Limitations

-   We used **average country-level costs**, which may not reflect variation between cities or universities.
-   **Scholarships and grants** were not considered, yet these can significantly lower actual costs.
-   **Exchange rates** fluctuate over time, which could impact affordability.
-   Language, cultural preferences, and long-term goals (e.g., migration, job prospects) were also **not included**, though they’re critical for many students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion & Recommendations

🧠 **Conclusion** - No direct link between QS rank and affordability. - Students can find **excellent education at lower costs** in countries like South Korea, Germany, and China. - **Affordability and quality must be balanced** when choosing a destination.

✅ **Recommendations** - **Students**: Look beyond rankings — evaluate total cost of attendance. - **Institutions & policymakers**: Be more transparent; offer **more financial support**. - **Future researchers**: Include job outcomes, immigration pathways, and scholarships for a full picture.
